# Marching Cubes Algorithm for TSDF

This program accepts a TSDF binary file, specifically the TSDF file generated by Kintinuous,
and performs the marching cubes algorithm on it to generate a mesh file for its surface. Other TSDF files might
also work but the code for file reading might need to be modified.

There are two separate files in the project, marching_cubes and tsdf.
Marching_cubes performs the marching cubes algorithm on the TSDF, and
tsdf is a faster tool for visualization that simply ouput a point cloud of all
the points in the TSDF with negative values.

This program requires PCL.

## Usage

The background TSDF should be named tsdf.bin and the TSDF with the object should be named tsdf2.bin.
Place these two files in this directory or provide its directory as a parameter when running the program.

By default the program will reconstruct the largest connected component. In case the target object is not the largest connected
component you can manually provide the index of the target object. The indeces of the top 10 largest components are printed in the console, and 
different components are given different colors in the color table according to thier indeces (%20). 
The color table is shown in the included color.html. You can thus find out the desired component according to its color.
