# Marching Cubes Algorithm for TSDF

This program accepts a TSDF binary file, specifically the TSDF file generated by Kintinuous,
and performs the marching cubes algorithm on it to generate a mesh file for its surface. Other TSDF files might
also work but the code for file reading might need to be modified.

There are two separate files in the project, marching_cubes and tsdf.
Marching_cubes performs the marching cubes algorithm on the TSDF, and
tsdf is a faster tool for visualization that simply ouput a point cloud of all
the points in the TSDF with negative values.

This program requires PCL.
